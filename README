Haven't made any effort to implement a delete but that should be trivial.
Will accept pull requests!

ps:
  Supports all but number -1, accepting pull requests that change this
  dependecy to something like MIN_INTEGER or whatever that is.
  Look the printing code for reasons, why '-1' is bad.

  Also Delete... might not be that trivial ahiahiahiahia...
  Depends if you have complete understanding what SK_innerfind does.
